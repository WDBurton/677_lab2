[CAT] The Catalogue Server


    [CAT][SUM]
    

    [CAT][TXT]
    
    The Catalogue Server operates around, primarily, two .txt files: CATALOGUE.txt and ORDER_LOGXX.txt.  Both shall be stored in the '/CAT_FILES'
    folder.

    CATALOGUE.txt contains the current books for the current run, in four lines, for the four books.  It shall store the ID number, name, and
    total amount of each book.  For example:  '2,7: RPCs for Dummies.', would indicate that for book ID 2, which is called 'RPCs for Dummiex.',
    the catalogue holds 7 copies.

    ORDER_LOGXX.txt contains the entire order log -- it starts with a summary of what books are stored within the catalogue; not full information,
    but just the numbers.  [IE, the first line will be: '1:1 2:1 3:8 4:2' , for book id 1 and 2 each having 1 copy, book id 3 having eight copies,
    and book id 4 having two copies]  After that, each new line will consist of orders that have been comitted, with a client id(???).  An example
    line would be: 'CLIENT_ID_9843: 4', for the specified client purchasing a copy of book 4.  The last line will be similar to the first, just
    with the new totals for books.

    Further, the 'XX' in ORDER_LOGXX are for the run numbers.  In the event of, for example, testing, we want to be able to keep track of which run
    had which order logs and ended with what.
